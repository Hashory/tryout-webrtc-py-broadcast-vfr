# WebRTC Variable Frame Rate Streaming

> [!Warning] 
> This project was generated by AI.

This project demonstrates a WebRTC-based video streaming application with variable frame rate capabilities. It includes a Python server and a web-based client.

```

## Requirements

### Server
- Python
- uv
- Required Python packages:
  - `aiohttp`
  - `aiortc`
  - `opencv-python`
  - `numpy`

### Client
- Modern web browser with WebRTC support (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## Setup

### Install Dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

### Run the Server

```bash
uv run server.py
```

### Access the Client

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://<server-ip>:8080`.

## Usage

1. Click **Start Connection** to establish a WebRTC connection with the server.
2. Use **Request Frame** to request a new video frame from the server.
3. Click **Disconnect** to close the connection.

## Code Overview

### `server.py`
- Implements a WebRTC server using `aiortc`.
- Handles SDP offers from clients and responds with SDP answers.
- Generates video frames dynamically using OpenCV.
- Manages WebRTC `RTCPeerConnection` and `RTCDataChannel`.

### `client.js`
- Manages WebRTC connection and DataChannel on the client side.
- Sends frame requests to the server via DataChannel.
- Displays received video frames in a `<video>` element.

### `client.html`
- Provides a user interface for the client.
- Includes buttons for starting/stopping the connection and requesting frames.
